An external library manipulating by a pokemon game core to generate chunks of a procedural world, don't manage game logic or rendering, its only purpose is to generate world chunks asynchronously in a given area.

The visual is a very basic rendering used for test purpose : black for sea, red flowers/bush, yellow patches of tall grasses.
